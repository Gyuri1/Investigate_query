# This python script shows the result of the Umbrella Investigate analysis.

Please update the script with your invetigate token API key!

- Run this way:
   -     python investigate_domains domainfile.txt




Domainfile should look like (one domain name per line WITHOUT HTTPS://):
- domain1.com
- domain2.com
- ....

I attached an example file as well (domains5.txt).
